Routing
1. web.php returns a controller to view on the webpage    //Route::get('/home', [App\Http\Controllers\HomeController::class, 'index'])->name('home');
2. this goes to the HomeController and runs that code
3.  The first code that runs is public function __construct() which runs $this->middleware('auth');
    - This makes sure the user is authorized before showing the page
4. If the user is authorized, they can login.
