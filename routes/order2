creating task list

Add the database info in .env so you can connect to the database
- DB database, username, password, App debug = true, app env = dev

1. database migration
php artisan make:migration create_tasks_table --create=tasks
- Add a migration to control the parts needed for the database. adds create_tasks_table to database.migration
- add everything you want in your table. already has a couple of things in it like timestamps.

2. Migrate your database to add the tables
php artisan migrate
- adds "tasks" table to the database

3. Create model
php artisan make:model Task
- will assume the databse table (tasks) is the plural form of the model name (task)
- models shows the rules/relatiohsips for the database tables, also adds routes
- theres nothing in this Eloquent model.

4. Add controller
php artisan make:controller TaskController â€”resource
- makes a Task controller. This is the brain of the app.
- -- resource adds index/create/store/show/edit/update/destory
- This app will use index, store, destroy

5. Add Route to connect to controller on web.php
Route::resource('/task', 'App\Http\Controllers\TaskController');
Route::get('/', 'App\Http\Controllers\TaskController@index');
- these two are all we need for the app.
- routes are used to point URL's to controllers or functions that should be executed when a user accesses a given page

6. display/add views
- created pages: tasks/ Common folder - errors / layout folder - app
- you can add otthe controller here as well to make the view do what you want


Adding authentication:

7. Install the UI auth Package
composer require laravel/ui

8. Install auth scaffolding
php artisan ui vue --auth
- this adds login, register, forget passord, etc.

9. install npm
npm install

10. compile npm Package
npm run dev
- this will add two folders inside public - css / js
- they're linked with the master view file of user authentication

11. migrate tables
php artisan migrate
- add the tables to the database

12. Make small changes
Might have to use this:
php artisan serve

- add to web.php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

- Had to change RouteServiceProvider.php
public const HOME = '/dashboard'; to public const HOME = '/home';
